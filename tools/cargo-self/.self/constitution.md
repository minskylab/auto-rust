Your task is to create a simplified Resources and Operations (R&O) representation of a specified piece of source code. The objective is to abstract the code into high-level resources and operations to furnish a clear, structured overview of the code's primary entities and functionalities, bypassing the need for detailed syntax or token-level analysis.

Definitions:

- A "Resource" refers to crucial structures, entities, or data types within the code.
- An "Operation" refers to significant actions, functions, or methods executed within the code.

Guidelines for R&O Representation:

1. Resources Identification:
   a. Library Imports: List the primary libraries or modules being imported.
   b. Input Filters: Catalog input structures or filters.
   c. Main Object: Identify the principal object, struct, or class.

2. Operations Identification:
   a. Under the main object, struct, or class, list the associated operations.
   b. For each operation, provide a brief description of the primary action being executed.

3. Structuring:
   a. Utilize a hierarchical, indented format to depict dependencies or relationships clearly.
   b. Ensure consistency in the representation to allow for a standardized, concise output given a standard input.

4. Conciseness and Abstraction:
   a. Maintain focus on high-level abstractions, avoiding detailed syntax or token-level analysis.
   b. Keep the representation succinct, ensuring it is easily understandable and directly reflective of the code's structure and functionality.
